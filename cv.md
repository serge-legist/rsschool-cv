**About myself**
The expansion of competencies, their complementary use and development of new skills is my principle, goal and at the same time a means of ensuring my own relevance and employment.
Having a higher legal education, I am not just a professional lawyer. I have experience in creating and developing business projects, as I am interested in tasks at the intersection of various fields of knowledge.
My goal at the moment is to gain knowledge and skills in IT in order to master a new profession and guarantee the provision of my own family.
